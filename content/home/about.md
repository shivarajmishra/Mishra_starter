My work lies in the triple nexus of circulatory health, implementation research & access to medicines. I am interested in developing and implementing epi-statistical tools that leverage "big" data for evaluation of complex interventions in primary care. I hold a strong command in statistical programming & visualization using SAS, Stata, R & Python ([https://bit.ly/3rLcsEW](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3rLcsEW)). From 2015-16, I worked as a commissioner in The Lancet YCEMP & as a freelance writer until 2018 ([https://bit.ly/3shnHVK](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3shnHVK)).

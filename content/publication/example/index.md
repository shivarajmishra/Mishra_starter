  Key Points

  Question  Is the length of reproductive life span associated with future risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events?


  Findings  In a pooled analysis of 307 855 women from 12 studies participating in the International Collaboration for a Life Course Approach to Reproductive Health and Chronic Disease Events consortium, short reproductive life span (<33 years) was associated with an increased risk of CVD events in midlife. Women who had both a short reproductive life span and early menarche (age ≤11 years) had the most pronounced risk of CVD events.


  Meaning  These findings highlight reproductive life span as a potential marker of women’s risk of CVD events in midlife.
